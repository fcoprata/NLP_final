This repository was created in order to create a final evaluation project at Dell Lead, the current company I work for, I was asked to create a project from the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset that does a text analysis and presents its toxicity analysis , with that, we were asked to create a training script and another classification scrip, to work with the best model and receive another dataset and deliver a dataset with the results of the analysis. In addition another script has been provided for us to do an individualized text analysis, where you can enter your text or phrase and receive a toxicity analysis this script is in the toxicity_text.ipynb document
